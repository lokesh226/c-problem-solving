// Seive formula
// given a number n print all the prime numbers smaller than or equal to n it is also given that n is a small number
// 1)according to this algorithem we aill mark all the numbers which are divisible by 2 and are greater that or equal to square 
// of it
//2) now we will move to the next unmarked number 3 and mark all the numbers which are multiple of 3 and are greater than or equal 
// to square of it
